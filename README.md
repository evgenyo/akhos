Akhos is an online discussion community. Users can create topics on variety of interests and discuss them along side each other. 

Built on MEAN stack and hosted on Heroku.

## Live Site
[Akhos](www.akhos.co)

## Installation
Download/clone the repo. Install and run MongoDB if you haven't already. Go to directory and type **npm install**, and then **npm start**. The site will be live on localhost:3000. 

For development, there are grunt tasks set up. Type **grunt watch** for any CSS and JS changes. I suggest installing Nodemon **npm install -g nodemon** to monitor changes in any files in the directory. Start local server with **nodemon bin/www**.
